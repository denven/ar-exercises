# 1. Use Active Record's `create` class method multiple times to create 3 stores in the database:
# / * Burnaby (annual_revenue of 300000, carries men's and women's apparel)
# / * Richmond (annual_revenue of 1260000 carries women's apparel only)
# / * Gastown (annual_revenue of 190000 carries men's apparel only)
# 2. Output (`puts`) the number of the stores using ActiveRecord's `count` method, \
# to ensure that there are three stores in the database.

# Your code goes below here ...

Store.create(name: "Burnaby", annual_revenue: "300000", mens_apparel: "true", womens_apparel: "true")
Store.create(name: "Richmond", annual_revenue: "1260000", mens_apparel: "false", womens_apparel: "true")
Store.create(name: "Gastown", annual_revenue: "190000", mens_apparel: "true", womens_apparel: "false")

puts "Number of stores: #{Store.count}"
